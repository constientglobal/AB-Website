    <p class="text-secondary fs-6">
      A loan is a sum of money borrowed by one party from another, with the understanding that it will be repaid,
      usually with interest, over a specified period. Loans can be
      <strong>secured</strong> (backed by collateral) or
      <strong>unsecured</strong> (not backed by collateral), and their terms vary widely depending on the type of loan,
      the lender, and the borrower's creditworthiness.
