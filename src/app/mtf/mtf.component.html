            At <strong>Absolute Broking Private Limited</strong>, we offer the Margin Trading Facility (MTF) to empower
            discerning
            investors and traders to take advantage of market opportunities by leveraging their capital. MTF allows
            you to buy more shares than your available funds, enhancing your potential returns (and risks) by paying
            only a fraction of the total trade value upfront.
