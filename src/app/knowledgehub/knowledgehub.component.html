          <h5 class="mb-3">Your Security is Our Priority</h5>

          <p>
            At Absolute Broking Private Limited, we are committed to providing you with a secure and reliable platform
            for all your financial transactions.
            In the digital age, staying vigilant against online fraud is crucial. We urge all our clients to be aware of
            common fraud tactics and take necessary precautions to protect their investments and personal information.
          </p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Key Security Measures We Employ:</h5>
          <p><strong>Robust Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted through our platforms is secured with advanced
            encryption technologies.</p>
          <p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> We encourage and support MFA to add an extra layer of
            security to your accounts.</p>
          <p><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> Our systems undergo continuous monitoring and regular security
            audits to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">How You Can Protect Yourself:</h5>
          <p><strong>Be Suspicious of Unsolicited Communications:</strong> Be wary of emails, SMS, or calls asking for
            personal details, account numbers, passwords, or OTPs, even if they appear to be from Absolute Broking. We
            will never ask for your password or OTP.</p>
          <p><strong>Verify Sender Identity:</strong> Always check the sender's email address or phone number.
            Fraudsters often use similar-looking addresses to trick you.</p>
          <p><strong>Never Share Credentials:</strong> Your login credentials (username, password, PIN, OTP) are
            strictly personal. Do not share them with anyone, including individuals claiming to be from Absolute Broking
            or any other financial institution.</p>
          <p><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create complex passwords that combine letters, numbers, and
            symbols, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.</p>
          <p><strong>Beware of Phishing Links:</strong> Do not click on suspicious links in emails or messages. Always
            type our website URL directly into your browser.</p>
          <p><strong>Regularly Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Check your transaction history and account statements
            regularly for any unauthorized activity. Report discrepancies immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>Keep Your Software Updated:</strong> Ensure your operating system, browser, and antivirus software
            are always up to date.</p>
          <p><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious activity or believe your
            account has been compromised, contact Absolute Broking Private Limited immediately through our official
            customer support channels.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Your proactive approach, combined with our robust security measures, forms the best defense against online
            fraud.

          </p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Our Commitment to Your Security:</h5>
          <p><strong>Advanced Encryption Protocols:</strong> We utilize industry-leading encryption technologies (like
            SSL/TLS) to secure all data transmissions between your device and our servers, ensuring your personal and
            financial information remains confidential.</p>
          <p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> We strongly encourage and provide Multi-Factor
            Authentication (MFA) as an essential layer of security. This requires more than just a password,
            significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your account.</p>

            tools for real-time monitoring and threat detection. We proactively identify and neutralize potential cyber

            with the latest security enhancements.</p>
          <p><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Our data centers and network infrastructure are built with
            state-of-the-art security measures, including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and access controls,
            to protect against unauthorized access.</p>
          <p><strong>Employee Training & Protocols:</strong> Our team undergoes rigorous training on cyber security best
            practices and data protection protocols, ensuring that human elements also contribute to a secure
            environment.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Your Role in Staying Secure:</h5>
          <p>While we implement comprehensive security measures, your vigilance is equally crucial. We urge you to:</p>
          <p><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create complex passwords for your Absolute Broking account
            and avoid reusing them across different platforms.</p>
          <p><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Activate MFA for an added layer of protection.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Be Wary of Phishing & Scams:</strong> Never click on suspicious links or open attachments from
            unknown senders. Be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages asking for personal or account details.
            Absolute Broking will never ask for your password or OTP.</p>
          <p><strong>Keep Your Devices Secure:</strong> Ensure your operating system, web browser, and antivirus
            software are always up to date.</p>
          <p><strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Regularly review your transaction history and account statements
            for any unusual or unauthorized activity. Report anything suspicious immediately.</p>

          </div>
          <h5 class="mb-3">Protect Your Investments</h5>

          <p>
            At Absolute Broking Private Limited, we are committed to safeguarding your financial interests. While the
            stock market offers immense opportunities, it's also a target for fraudsters. Being aware of common stock
            market scams and taking preventive measures is crucial to protect your hard-earned money.
          </p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Common Stock Market Scams to Watch Out For:</h5>
          <p><strong>"Pump and Dump" Schemes:</strong> Fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a low-value stock
            (the "pump") through false and misleading positive statements, then sell their own cheaply acquired shares
            at the inflated price (the "dump"), leaving unsuspecting investors with worthless stock.</p>
          <p><strong>Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes:</strong> These schemes promise high returns with little or no risk, paying
            early investors with money taken from later investors. They collapse when new money stops coming in.</p>
          <p><strong>Phishing and Impersonation:</strong> Scammers impersonate legitimate financial institutions or
            advisors through fake emails, websites, or calls to trick you into revealing personal information, login
            credentials, or transferring funds.</p>
          <p><strong>Unsolicited "Hot Tips":</strong> Be wary of unsolicited calls, emails, or social media messages
            offering "guaranteed" high returns or "insider information" on specific stocks. These are often traps.</p>
          <p><strong>Fake Investment Products:</strong> Fraudsters may promote non-existent or unregistered investment
            products, often with complex terms, to lure investors.</p>
          <p><strong>Advance Fee Scams:</strong> You might be asked to pay an upfront fee for a "special" investment
            opportunity, only for the promised returns or investment to never materialize.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">How to Protect Yourself:</h5>
          <p><strong>Verify Everything:</strong> Always verify the credentials of any person or firm offering investment
            advice or opportunities. Check their registration with regulatory bodies (e.g., SEBI in India).</p>
          <p><strong>Do Your Own Research:</strong> Never invest based solely on unsolicited advice. Always research the
            company, its financials, and the market conditions yourself.</p>
          <p><strong>Be Skeptical of "Guaranteed" Returns:</strong> All investments carry risk. Be extremely suspicious
            of anyone promising high, guaranteed returns with no risk.</p>
          <p><strong>Protect Your Personal Information:</strong> Never share your passwords, OTPs, or sensitive
            financial details with anyone. Absolute Broking will never ask for these.</p>
          <p><strong>Use Official Channels:</strong> Only interact with Absolute Broking Private Limited through our
            official website, verified mobile apps, and official contact numbers.</p>
          <p><strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Regularly check your trading and demat account statements for any
            unauthorized transactions.</p>
          <p><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious activity, receive unusual
            communications, or suspect fraud, report it immediately to Absolute Broking Private Limited and the relevant
            regulatory authorities.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">

          <h5 class="mb-3">Tailoring Investments to Your Comfort</h5>

          <p>
            At Absolute Broking Private Limited, we understand that every investor is unique, with different financial
            goals,
            time horizons, and tolerance for risk. Our comprehensive Risk Profiling process is designed to accurately
            assess
            your individual risk appetite, ensuring that your investment portfolio is perfectly aligned with your
            comfort
            level and financial objectives.
          </p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Why is Risk Profiling Essential?</h5>
          <p><strong>Personalized Investment Strategy:</strong> Understanding your risk profile allows us to recommend
            investment products and strategies that are best suited for you, avoiding portfolios that are either too
            aggressive or too conservative for your comfort.</p>
          <p><strong>Informed Decision-Making:</strong> It helps you make clear-headed investment decisions, especially
            during
            market volatility, as you'll have a better understanding of how your portfolio is expected to behave under
            different conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>Optimized Returns (Risk-Adjusted):</strong> By matching your investments to your risk tolerance, we
            aim
            to optimize your potential returns while staying within a level of risk you are comfortable with, leading to
            a
            more sustainable and less stressful investment journey.</p>
          <p><strong>Long-Term Financial Planning:</strong> Risk profiling is a foundational step in effective long-term
            financial planning, ensuring that your investment path supports your life goals.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Our Risk Profiling Process:</h5>
          <p>Our process is simple, insightful, and designed to give us a clear picture of your investment personality:
          </p>
          <p><strong>Confidential Questionnaire:</strong> You will complete a carefully designed questionnaire that
            covers
            aspects like your financial goals, investment experience, income stability, existing liabilities, and your
            emotional response to market fluctuations.</p>
          <p><strong>Expert Analysis:</strong> Our financial advisors will analyze your responses to determine your risk
            profile, classifying it into categories such as Conservative, Moderate, Balanced, Growth, or Aggressive.</p>
          <p><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Based on your determined risk profile, we will provide
            tailored
            investment recommendations and portfolio structures that align with your comfort level and help you pursue
            your
            financial aspirations.</p>
          <p><strong>Regular Review:</strong> Your risk profile is not static. We encourage periodic reviews to ensure
            your
            portfolio continues to match your evolving financial situation and market outlook. Invest with confidence,
            knowing
            your portfolio is built for you.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">
            Let Absolute Broking Private Limited help you understand your risk profile and embark on an investment
