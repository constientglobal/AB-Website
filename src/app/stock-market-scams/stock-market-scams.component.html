        <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
        <p>
          At Absolute Broking Private Limited, we are committed to safeguarding your financial interests. While the
          stock market offers immense opportunities, it's also a target for fraudsters. Being aware of common stock
          market scams and taking preventive measures is crucial to protect your hard-earned money.
        </p>

        <!-- Common Scams -->
        <h5 class="mt-4 text-dark-blue fw-bold border-start border-4 border-warning ps-3">Common Stock Market Scams to
          Watch Out For:</h5>
        <p><strong>"Pump and Dump" Schemes:</strong> Fraudsters artificially inflate the price of a low-value stock
          (the "pump") through false and misleading positive statements, then sell their own cheaply acquired shares
          at the inflated price (the "dump"), leaving unsuspecting investors with worthless stock.</p>
        <p><strong>Ponzi/Pyramid Schemes:</strong> These schemes promise high returns with little or no risk, paying
          early investors with money taken from later investors. They collapse when new money stops coming in.</p>
        <p><strong>Phishing and Impersonation:</strong> Scammers impersonate legitimate financial institutions or
          advisors through fake emails, websites, or calls to trick you into revealing personal information, login
          credentials, or transferring funds.</p>
        <p><strong>Unsolicited "Hot Tips":</strong> Be wary of unsolicited calls, emails, or social media messages
          offering "guaranteed" high returns or "insider information" on specific stocks. These are often traps.</p>
        <p><strong>Fake Investment Products:</strong> Fraudsters may promote non-existent or unregistered investment
          products, often with complex terms, to lure investors.</p>
        <p><strong>Advance Fee Scams:</strong> You might be asked to pay an upfront fee for a "special" investment
          opportunity, only for the promised returns or investment to never materialize.</p>

        <!-- Protection Tips -->
        <h5 class="mt-4 text-dark-blue fw-bold border-start border-4 border-success ps-3">How to Protect Yourself:</h5>
        <p><strong>Verify Everything:</strong> Always verify the credentials of any person or firm offering investment
          advice or opportunities. Check their registration with regulatory bodies (e.g., SEBI in India).</p>
        <p><strong>Do Your Own Research:</strong> Never invest based solely on unsolicited advice. Always research the
          company, its financials, and the market conditions yourself.</p>
        <p><strong>Be Skeptical of "Guaranteed" Returns:</strong> All investments carry risk. Be extremely suspicious
          of anyone promising high, guaranteed returns with no risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Protect Your Personal Information:</strong> Never share your passwords, OTPs, or sensitive
          financial details with anyone. Absolute Broking will never ask for these.</p>
        <p><strong>Use Official Channels:</strong> Only interact with Absolute Broking Private Limited through our
          official website, verified mobile apps, and official contact numbers.</p>
        <p><strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Regularly check your trading and demat account statements for any
          unauthorized transactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious activity, receive unusual
          communications, or suspect fraud, report it immediately to Absolute Broking Private Limited and the relevant
          regulatory authorities.</p>

        <!-- Closing Note -->
