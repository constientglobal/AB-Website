          At Absolute Broking Private Limited, your digital security is paramount. In an increasingly connected world,
          we are relentlessly committed to protecting your sensitive information, financial assets, and privacy from
          cyber threats. Our robust cyber security framework is designed to create a safe and impenetrable environment

        <!-- Our Commitment -->
        <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Our Commitment to Your Security:</h5>
        <div class="ps-3 border-start border-4 border-primary mb-3">
          <p><strong>Advanced Encryption Protocols:</strong> We utilize industry-leading encryption technologies (like
            SSL/TLS) to secure all data transmissions between your device and our servers, ensuring your personal and
            financial information remains confidential.</p>
          <p><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> We strongly encourage and provide Multi-Factor
            Authentication (MFA) as an essential layer of security. This requires more than just a password,
            significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your account.</p>
          <p><strong>Continuous Monitoring & Threat Detection:</strong> Our systems are equipped with sophisticated
            tools for real-time monitoring and threat detection. We proactively identify and neutralize potential cyber
            threats before they can impact your security.</p>
          <p><strong>Regular Security Audits & Updates:</strong> We conduct frequent security audits and penetration
            testing by independent experts to identify and patch vulnerabilities. Our systems are continuously updated
            with the latest security enhancements.</p>
          <p><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Our data centers and network infrastructure are built with
            state-of-the-art security measures, including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and access controls,
            to protect against unauthorized access.</p>
          <p><strong>Employee Training & Protocols:</strong> Our team undergoes rigorous training on cyber security best
            practices and data protection protocols, ensuring that human elements also contribute to a secure
            environment.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Your Role -->
        <h5 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">Your Role in Staying Secure:</h5>
        <div class="ps-3 border-start border-4 border-success mb-3">
          <p>While we implement comprehensive security measures, your vigilance is equally crucial. We urge you to:</p>
          <p><strong>Use Strong, Unique Passwords:</strong> Create complex passwords for your Absolute Broking account
            and avoid reusing them across different platforms.</p>
          <p><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Activate MFA for an added layer of protection.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Be Wary of Phishing & Scams:</strong> Never click on suspicious links or open attachments from
            unknown senders. Be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages asking for personal or account details.
            Absolute Broking will never ask for your password or OTP.</p>
          <p><strong>Keep Your Devices Secure:</strong> Ensure your operating system, web browser, and antivirus
            software are always up to date.</p>
          <p><strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong> Regularly review your transaction history and account statements
            for any unusual or unauthorized activity. Report anything suspicious immediately.</p>
          <p><strong>Use Official Channels:</strong> Always access our services through our official website or verified
