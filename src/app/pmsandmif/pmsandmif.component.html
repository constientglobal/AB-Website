              <p class="text-secondary mb-0">
                Portfolio Management Services (PMS) offer professional management of an individual's investment
                portfolio.
                Unlike mutual funds, where your money is pooled with others and invested in a common portfolio, in PMS,
                you
                own the individual securities directly. A dedicated fund manager or team manages your portfolio
                according to
                your specific financial goals, risk appetite, and investment horizon.

                Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) are privately pooled investment vehicles that collect funds from
                sophisticated
                investors, whether Indian or foreign, for investing in accordance with a defined investment policy. AIFs
                typically
                invest in assets that are not traditionally covered by conventional investment products like stocks,
                bonds, or
                mutual funds. They are regulated by SEBI.

              <ul class="mb-0">
                <li><strong>Potentially Higher Returns:</strong> Due to their specialized strategies, active management,
                  and
                  focus on niche or less liquid markets, they aim to generate alpha (returns above a benchmark) or
                  superior
                  absolute returns.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> They provide access to asset classes and investment strategies not
                  typically available through public markets or traditional mutual funds, enhancing portfolio
                  diversification.</li>
                <li><strong>Active & Specialized Management:</strong> Managed by highly experienced professionals with
                  expertise in specific asset classes or strategies.</li>

                  investments
                  closely with individual financial goals and risk tolerance.</li>
                <li><strong>Access to Private Markets (AIFs):</strong> AIFs open doors to private equity, venture
                  capital,
                  real estate, and other private investment opportunities.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Efficiency:</strong> Certain AIF structures may offer tax advantages depending on the

        <p>Despite the potential for high returns, PMS and AIFs come with significant risks:</p>
        <ul class="mb-0">
          <li><strong>High Investment Thresholds:</strong> The high minimum investment makes them inaccessible to most
            retail investors.</li>
          <li><strong>Illiquidity:</strong> Many AIFs, especially those in private equity or real estate, involve long
            lock-in periods, making it difficult to exit investments quickly. PMS, while offering direct ownership, is
            also designed for long-term holding.</li>
          <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> All investments are subject to market fluctuations.</li>
          <li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> Risk of default by the underlying companies or entities in which the funds
            invest.</li>
          <li><strong>Manager Risk:</strong> Performance is heavily dependent on the skill and expertise of the fund
            manager/investment manager.</li>
          <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> The strategies employed can be complex and less transparent than traditional
            investments.</li>
          <li><strong>High Fees:</strong> Management fees and performance fees can be substantial, impacting net
            returns.</li>
          <li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> Changes in SEBI or other regulatory frameworks can affect the
            operations and returns of PMS/AIFs.</li>
