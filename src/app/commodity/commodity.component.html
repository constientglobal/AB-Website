            <p class="text-muted">
              A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other goods of the same type.
              Commodities are often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. They are typically
              traded
              on commodity exchanges, where their prices are determined by supply and demand dynamics.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-3">Commodities can be broadly categorized into:</p>

            <ul class="list-unstyled text-dark ps-2">
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Agricultural:</strong> Grains (wheat, corn, rice), livestock (cattle, hogs),
                softs (coffee, sugar, cotton).</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Energy:</strong> Crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, heating oil.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Metals:</strong> Precious metals (gold, silver, platinum), industrial metals
                (copper, aluminum, zinc).</li>
              <li><strong>Environmental:</strong> Carbon credits, renewable energy certificates.</li>

            <p class="text-muted mb-3">
              Investing in commodities can offer several distinct advantages within a diversified portfolio:
            </p>

            <ol class="text-dark ps-3">
              <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Diversification:</strong> Commodities often have a low correlation with traditional assets like
                stocks and bonds. This means they can move independently, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk
                and
                enhancing returns, especially during periods of equity market downturns.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Inflation Hedge:</strong> As raw material prices tend to rise with inflation, commodities can
                serve
                as a strong hedge against rising living costs, helping to preserve purchasing power.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Potential for High Returns:</strong> Prices of commodities can be highly volatile, leading to
                significant price movements and opportunities for substantial gains for astute investors.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-3">
                <strong>Tangible Assets:</strong> Unlike stocks or bonds, commodities are physical assets, which can
                appeal
                to investors seeking tangible investments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Global Demand:</strong> The increasing global population and industrialization drive consistent
                demand for various commodities, influencing their long-term value.

              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Spot Price:</strong> The current market price at which a commodity can be bought
                or sold for immediate delivery.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Futures Contracts:</strong> Agreements to buy or sell a specific quantity of a
                commodity at a predetermined price on a future date. This is the most common way to invest in
                commodities without taking physical delivery.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Options:</strong> Give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or
                sell a commodity future at a specified price before a certain date.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Commodity Exchange:</strong> Regulated marketplaces where commodities and their
                derivatives are traded (e.g., MCX, NCDEX, CME Group).</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Contango:</strong> A market condition where the futures price of a commodity is
                higher than the spot price.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Backwardation:</strong> A market condition where the futures price of a commodity
                is lower than the spot price.</li>
              <li class="mb-0"><strong>Supply and Demand:</strong> The primary drivers of commodity prices, influenced

              <li class="mb-2"><strong>High Volatility:</strong> Commodity prices can fluctuate wildly due to unexpected
                events (e.g., natural disasters, political instability, sudden changes in demand).</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Geopolitical Risk:</strong> Many commodities are produced in politically unstable
                regions, making their supply vulnerable to disruptions.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Storage and Carrying Costs:</strong> For physical commodities, there are costs
                associated with storage, insurance, and transportation.</li>
              <li class="mb-2"><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some less-traded commodities or specific futures
                contracts
                might have lower liquidity, making them harder to buy or sell quickly without impacting prices.</li>
              <li class="mb-0"><strong>Leverage Risk:</strong> Futures and options involve leverage, which can amplify
                both
                gains and losses.</li>
