      <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark-blue mb-3">What is Equity?</h4>
      <p class="text-secondary mb-3">
        In simple terms, equity represents ownership. When you buy shares of a company, you become a shareholder,
        meaning you own a small portion of that company. This ownership gives you certain rights, including a
        claim on the company's assets and earnings.
      </p>
      <p class="fw-semibold text-dark mb-2">Equity can refer to:</p>
      <ul class="text-dark ps-3 mb-0">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Stock (Shares):</strong> Ownership in a public company.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Owner's Equity:</strong> Assets minus liabilities on a balance sheet.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Equity:</strong> Market value of your home minus the mortgage owed.</li>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              The primary goal for many equity investors is to see the value of their shares increase over time.
              As a company grows and becomes more profitable, its stock price tends to rise, allowing you to sell your
              shares for a profit.
            </p>

              <li class="list-group-item bg-white border-0 px-0 text-dark">
                <strong>Capital Appreciation:</strong> The value of shares tends to rise as companies grow and become
                more
                profitable, offering potential profit on sale.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-white border-0 px-0 text-dark">
                <strong>Dividends:</strong> Many companies pay out a portion of their profits to shareholders, providing
                regular income.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-white border-0 px-0 text-dark">
                <strong>Inflation Hedge:</strong> Historically, equity investments have outpaced inflation, preserving and growing your purchasing power.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-white border-0 px-0 text-dark">
                <strong>Liquidity:</strong> Shares of public companies are generally easy to trade on stock exchanges,
                offering quick access to funds.
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item bg-white border-0 px-0 text-dark">
                <strong>Diversification:</strong> Equity helps spread risk across various sectors and asset classes in
                an
                investment portfolio.

              <li class="mb-3">

              <li class="mb-3">

              <li>
                <strong>Inflation Risk:</strong> Although equity can be an inflation hedge, unexpected high inflation
