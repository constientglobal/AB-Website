      Markets</h2>
    <p class="fw-light text-center fs-5">
      Welcome to our comprehensive guide on Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) â€“ a pivotal moment when a private company
      offers its shares to the public for the first time. An IPO allows a company to raise capital from public
      investors, transitioning from a private entity to a publicly traded one. For investors, it offers an opportunity
      to buy shares of a company at its initial offering.

          <p class="fs-6 text-secondary mb-0">
            An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process by which a private corporation issues new shares of stock to
            the public for the first time. This transition from private to public ownership allows the company to raise
            capital from a wide range of investors. Once the IPO is complete, the company's shares are listed on a stock exchange,
            where they can be bought and sold by the general public.

          <h4 class="fw-bold text-dark-blue mb-3">Why Do Companies Go Public (IPO)?</h4>
          <ul class="text-secondary fs-6 mb-0">
            <li><strong>Capital Raising:</strong> The primary reason is to raise a significant amount of capital to fund
              growth, expansion, research and development, debt repayment, or acquisitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Liquidity for Early Investors:</strong> It provides an exit strategy for early investors (like
              venture capitalists and angel investors) and founders, allowing them to cash out their investments.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Public Image and Brand Recognition:</strong> Being a publicly traded company can
              significantly boost a company's visibility, credibility, and brand recognition.</li>
            <li><strong>Employee Motivation:</strong> Publicly traded shares can be used as currency for employee stock
              option plans, helping to attract and retain talent.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Fundraising:</strong> Once public, a company can more easily raise additional capital
              through secondary offerings.</li>
            <li><strong>Acquisitions:</strong> Publicly traded stock can be used as currency for future mergers and
              acquisitions.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul class="text-secondary fs-6 mb-0">
            <li><strong>Selection of Underwriters (Investment Banks):</strong> The company chooses one or more investment
              banks (underwriters) to manage the IPO. These banks advise on pricing, timing, and market conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Due Diligence and Regulatory Filings:</strong> The underwriters conduct extensive due diligence on
              the company. The company then prepares and files a detailed prospectus (in India, a Draft Red Herring
              Prospectus or DRHP) with regulatory bodies like SEBI, providing comprehensive information about its
              business, financials, and risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Pricing the Shares:</strong> The company and underwriters determine the offer price per share,
              often based on market demand, company valuation, and comparable public companies. This can be a fixed price
              or through a book-building process.</li>
            <li><strong>Roadshow:</strong> The company's management and underwriters meet with potential institutional
              investors to generate interest and gauge demand for the shares.</li>
            <li><strong>Allocation and Listing:</strong> Shares are allocated to investors (institutional, high-net-worth,
              and retail). The shares then begin trading on a stock exchange (e.g., NSE, BSE) on the listing date.</li>

          <ul class="text-secondary fs-6 mb-0">
            <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> IPO stocks can be highly volatile, especially in the initial days or weeks of
              trading, due to speculative interest and limited trading history.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of History:</strong> New public companies have less historical financial data and public
              performance to analyze compared to established companies.</li>
            <li><strong>Overvaluation:</strong> There's a risk that the IPO might be overpriced, leading to a decline in
              share price after listing.</li>
            <li><strong>Lock-up Periods:</strong> Insiders (founders, early investors) are often subject to lock-up
              periods, after which they can sell their shares, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure
              on the stock price.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> The success of an IPO can be heavily influenced by overall market
              sentiment.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Allocation:</strong> Retail investors may receive only a small allocation or no allocation
              at all in highly sought-after IPOs.</li>
